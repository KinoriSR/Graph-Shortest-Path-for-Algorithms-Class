# Graph-Shortest-Path-for-Algorithms-Class

We had to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd's Algorithm each handling 3 graph representations listed below. All graphs were weighted, undirected and connected.
1) Adjacency Matrix
2) 1D Array representing the lower triangle of the adjacency matrix
3) Array of Linked Lists We were then asked to generate random graphs that were either complete or a tree then test the run time of each of the data structures for that graph. 

GraphGeneration.py: The program that randomly generates the complete and sparse (tree) graph. 
FinalTest.py: The program that varied tree size to check run times. I could set it up to average multiple runs, but didn't because it would take too long to run for the sake of the class. 
LinkedList.py: My implementation of a linked list.
